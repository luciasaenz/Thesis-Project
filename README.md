This GitHub repository gives information about how to reproduce every figure presented in my thesis report.

In order to be able to reproduce Figure 3, the permutation test density plots for HLA-A*29:01 and HLA-B*50:01 in both cohorts, follow the "HLA association with survival times (Fig.3)" code. The data needed can be found in discovery_data.xlsx and validation_data.xslx

In order to be able to reproduce Figure 4, the predicted number of binders for HLA-A*29:01 and HLA-B*50:01 across distinct peptide groups, follow the "Predicted number of binders across distinct peptide groups (Fig.4)" code. The data needed can be found in...

In order to be able to reproduce Figure 5, the comparaison of neoantigen binding affinity predictions from van allen et al. (2015) and our updated predictions, follow the "Comparison of binding affinities predictions (Fig.5)" code with the.
We got our updated predictions following the "NetpanMHC script" and with that applied the "Updated binding affinities (table)" code.

In order to be able to reproduce Figure 6, predicted neoantigen-binding affinity for HLA-A*29:01 and HLA-B*50:01, follow the "Predicted number of binders across distinct peptide groups  (Fig.6)" code. Use the updated binding affinities table.

In order to be able to reproduce Figure 8, the frequencies of HLA alleles in our cohorts, follow "HLA allele frequencies in cohorts (Fig.8)" code, with the discovery_data.xlsx and validation_data.xslx.

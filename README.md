# Thesis–Project

This GitHub repository provides all necessary data and instructions to reproduce the figures presented in my thesis report.


### Figure 3 – Permutation Test Density Plots
To reproduce the density plots showing HLA association with survival times for HLA-A*29:01 and HLA-B*50:01 in both cohorts:

- Use the code in: `HLA association with survival times (Fig.3)`
- Required data: `discovery_data.xlsx`, `validation_data.xlsx`


### Figure 4 – Predicted Number of Binders
To reproduce the predicted number of binders for HLA-A*29:01 and HLA-B*50:01 across distinct peptide groups:

- Use the code in: `Predicted number of binders across distinct peptide groups (Fig.4)`
- Required data: `Binding_peptide_numbers.xlsx`


### Figure 5.A – Comparison of Neoantigen Binding Affinity Predictions
To reproduce the comparison between neoantigen binding predictions from Van Allen et al. (2015) and our updated predictions:

- Use the code in: `Comparison of binding affinities predictions (Fig.5)`
- Required data: `Binding affinity predictions.xlsx`
- To reproduce the required data, use the code in `Updated binding affinities (table)`, after running the `NetpanMHC script` in the NetpanMHC software. For that, you will need the neoantigens and HLA sets per patient that can be found in `tables4_revised.csv` (Van Allen et al., 2015) and `discovery_data.xlsx` respectively.


### Figure 5.B – Predicted Neoantigen Binding Affinity
To reproduce the neoantigen-binding affinities comparaison between HLA-A*29:01 and HLA-B*50:01:

- Use the code in: `Predicted number of binders across distinct peptide groups (Fig.6)`
- Required data: `Binding affinity predictions.xlsx`


### Figure 7 – HLA Allele Frequencies in Cohorts
To reproduce the HLA allele frequency bar plots for the discovery and validation cohorts:

- Use the code in: `HLA allele frequencies in cohorts (Fig.8)`
- Required data: `discovery_data.xlsx`, `validation_data.xlsx`
